# Pexels-Clone
My clone of https://www.pexels.com/, I created this using HTML, SCSS, Javascript, and minimal amounts of jQuery. I copied the core functionality of the site of allowing users to search photos, and accredit creators. I did this using the pexels API in order to make an AJAX request and populate the site.
